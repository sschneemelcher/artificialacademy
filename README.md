# 🎓 Artificial Academy

Artificial Academy is a full-stack web application that I built to teach myself Go and to incorporate AI as a service using OpenAI's GPT-3 API. With this app, students can have chat-like conversations with StudyBot, an AI-powered chatbot, to help with their homework and studying.

But let's be real, StudyBot is pretty much a generic interface for having a conversation with GPT-3. However, with some creative prompts, StudyBot can provide some pretty cool responses that can be helpful to students. 🤖💬

One of the features that I'm really proud of in Artificial Academy is the ability to have multiple conversations with StudyBot. Each conversation is saved separately, so students can easily switch between topics or even ask StudyBot for help on different subjects. 📚💻
